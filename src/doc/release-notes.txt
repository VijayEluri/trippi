+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Version 1.1.2 - January 11th, 2007
==================================

 o Improved buffer flushing performance:
   - When the triple update buffer (MemUpdateBuffer) is flushed,
     it is now normalized first, to minimize the number of adds/deletes
	 to the underlying triplestore.  For example, if the buffer contains
	 the following: Add A, Del B, Add C, Add D, Del C, Del F, Add G, Add B,
	 flushing would have formerly resulted in five operations on the 
	 underlying triplestore: 1) Add(A), 2) Del(B), 3) Add(C,D), 4) Del(C,F), 
	 5) Add(G,B).  Now, it results in only two operations: 1) Add(A,D,G),
	 2) Del(F).

 o Minor documentation fix:
   - Fixed bugzilla URL in release notes for 1.1.1.

Version 1.1.1 - December 10th, 2006
===================================

 o Bug fixes:
   - Improper synchronization in MemUpdateBuffer.
     When many simultaneous updates were occurring, this had the potential 
     to result to lost or duplicate triples being flushed to the triplestore.
     See http://www.fedora.info/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=193

 o Build improvements:
   - Better identification of dependencies
   - lib.properties contains more detail about each library used
   - Added unit and integration tests (required to pass before release)
   - Added test, doc, and release targets

  <parameter name="ddlGenerator" label="Database adaptor class name">
    <description>
      Class name of an implementation of the org.nsdl.mptstore.core.DDLGenerator
      interface.  This provides RDBMS-specific commands for creating and dropping
      tables (and associated indexes, if any).

      Known implementations:
        org.nsdl.mptstore.impl.postgres.DerbyDDLGenerator
        org.nsdl.mptstore.impl.postgres.H2DDLGenerator
        org.nsdl.mptstore.impl.postgres.PostgresDDLGenerator

  <parameter name="jdbcDriver" label="The JDBC driver class name">
    <description> 
      The vendor-specific jar(s) must be in the classpath.
      Examples: 
        org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
        org.h2.Driver
        org.postgresql.Driver 
    </description>
  </parameter>
  <parameter name="jdbcURL" label="The JDBC URL">
    <description>
      Examples: 
        jdbc:derby:trippi;create=true
        jdbc:h2:file:h2/trippi
        jdbc:postgresql://localhost/trippi

  <parameter name="password" label="The password for connecting to the database"/>

  <parameter name="poolInitialSize" label="The initial size of the session pool">
    <description>This should be one or greater</description>
  </parameter>
  <parameter name="poolMaxSize" label="The maximum size of the session pool">
    <description>The session pool will automatically grow up to this size.</description>
  </parameter>

  <parameter name="fetchSize" label="The JDBC fetch size for queries">
    <description>
        This tells the underlying database how many results the client
        can accept in memory at a time.

        Specifying 0 will leave the behavior up to the database,
        which may result in client-side out of memory errors for large 
        queries.

        If the underlying database supports it, a larger value (like 1000)
        should be used.
    </description>
  </parameter>

  <parameter name="backslashIsEscape" label="Whether the backslash character is treated as an escape by the underlying database">
    <description>
      This tells MPTStore whether the underlying RDBMS treats a \ character
      as an escape character in SQL strings.

      For Postgres and MySQL, this should be specified as true.
      Many other databases (Oracle, etc.), do not implement this type
      of escaping, so this should given as false.

  <parameter name="autoFlushDormantSeconds"
             label="Seconds of buffer inactivity that will trigger an auto-flush.">
    <description>
      If this threshold is reached, flushing will occur in the background,
      during which time the buffer is still available for writing.
    </description>
  </parameter>
  <parameter name="autoFlushBufferSize" 
             label="The size at which the buffer should be auto-flushed.">
    <description>
      If this threshold is reached, flushing will occur in the background,
      during which time the buffer is still available for writing.
    </description>
  </parameter>
  <parameter name="bufferSafeCapacity"
             label="The maximum size the buffer can reach before being forcibly flushed.">
    <description>
      If this threshold is reached, flushing will occur in the foreground
      and the buffer will be locked for writing until it is finished.
      This should be larger than autoFlushBufferSize.
    </description>
  </parameter>
  <parameter name="bufferFlushBatchSize"
             label="The number of updates to send to the triplestore at a time.">
    <description>
      When flushing, this is the maximum number of triples to flush at once.
